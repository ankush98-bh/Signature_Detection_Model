# Signature Detection from Images

The Signature Detection from Images project is an application that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
to detect signatures within images. This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where automated signature verification 
or detection is required, such as in document processing systems, identity verification, and fraud detection.

# Introduction
Signature Detection from Images is a Python-based project that employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting signatures in images. 
The CNN architecture is utilized to learn and identify patterns within the images, 
allowing the model to make predictions regarding the presence of a signature.

# Aproch
Sign Detection model build by using of CNN and openCV. Firstly I add some non signature image and to increase diversity of the data 
done data augmentation. after that give label for images if image contain signature gives 1 and if not gives 0 after that preprocess the whole data.
and pass through the neural network(CNN). and predict the result by set one thresh. the value of thersh is 0.5. If predicted value is more that 
thresh then image conatains signature. after that by using openCV crop image by using boundry box.

# Important Libraries
    Python (>=3.6)
    TensorFlow (>=2.0)
    OpenCV
    Numpy
    Matplotlib.pyplot
    
# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
$ git clone []
$ cd Signature-Detection

Install the required Python packages using pip:
$ pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib 

# Ecducation
  Prepare your dataset by organizing the images of signatures and non-signatures into separate directories. 
  Modify the paths to these directories in the with_sign_files and without_sign_files variables within the Detect_sign class.
  
  Initialize an instance of the Detect_sign class and call the necessary methods:
        from signature_detection import Detect_sign
        
        with_sign_files = 'path_to_with_sign_images/'
        without_sign_files = 'path_to_without_sign_images/'
        test_path = 'path_to_test_image.jpg'
        
        obj = Detect_sign(with_sign_files, without_sign_files, test_path)
        obj.preprocessing()
        obj.nueral_network()
        obj.training_model()
        obj.evalution()
        obj.testing()
        
  The testing method will perform signature detection on the specified test image and display the result along with the cropped signature if detected.

# Configuration
  You can adjust the parameters and configurations within the code to fine-tune the model's performance. 
  The model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation methods can be modified according to your specific requirements.

# Results
  The model's performance can be evaluated using the validation accuracy and loss metrics after training. 
  Additionally, the application provides visual feedback by displaying the test image with the detected signature highlighted, if present.
